Use spread operator with numbers.

/*
I have been asked an programming question in an interview that can we use spread operator with a number so that the output
would be an array including numbers start from 1 to the number itself (such as [...7] outputs [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. To solve 
this I had added Symbol.iterator in the number prototype. 
*/


Number.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function* (i=1) {
  while (i < this){
     yield i++;
  }
}

Usage:-
[â€¦10]
Outputs:- 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
